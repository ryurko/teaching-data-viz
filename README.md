# The Landscape of College-level Data Visualization Courses, and the Benefits of Incorporating Statistical Thinking

This repository contains the data and code used to replicate the analysis and figures in the manuscript _The Landscape of College-level Data Visualization Courses, and the Benefits of Incorporating Statistical Thinking_.

The code folder is organized as follows:

+ `s0_prep_survey_sheets.R` cleans the collected data about data visualization courses

+ `s1_create_survey_figures.R` summarizes the survey data and generates Figures 1-4 (based on exploration in `sandbox.R`)

+ `barplotExample.R` replicates Figure 5

+ `densityExample.R` replicates Figure 6

+ `mapsExample.R` replicates Figure 7

+ `linIntExample.R` replicates Figure 8 and Table 3

+ `pcaExample.R` replicates Figure 9 and Table 4

Further details about the survey dataset can be found in Carnegie Mellon's Statistics and Data Science Repository [here](https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/social/data-viz-survey.html).
